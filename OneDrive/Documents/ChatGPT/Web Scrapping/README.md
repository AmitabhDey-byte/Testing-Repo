# SentinelScrape

SentinelScrape is a Bright Data Scraper Studio hackathon project for laptop price and inventory intelligence. It makes scraper reliability visible: when a competitor page changes and an extraction field collapses, the dashboard shows the failure, the proposed Bright Data heal, the human approval, the recovery, and the plain-English narration.

## What is tracked

Five laptop listing collectors are supported:

- eBay — `https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=laptop`
- Newegg — `https://www.newegg.com/p/pl?d=laptop`
- AliExpress — `https://www.aliexpress.com/w/wholesale-laptop.html`
- Target — `https://www.target.com/c/laptops-computers/-/N-5xtdh`
- Flipkart — `https://www.flipkart.com/search?q=laptop`

Each Bright Data collector is asked for product title, price, availability, seller or brand, rating, image URL, and listing URL. Etsy is intentionally not included because it is not a relevant laptop source.

## Self-healing story

The demo is a visible reliability loop:

1. **Site changes.** A listing page changes markup, causing one or more collector fields to become empty.
2. **Detection.** The scheduler runs every collector and compares the new snapshot with the last successful snapshot. A field is marked dropped only when completeness moves from strictly above 80% to strictly below 20%.
3. **Trust Layer incident.** The failed run, row counts, dropped fields, and collector are written to the configured database. The incident appears as open in the `/incidents` API and the dashboard feed.
4. **Heal / approve.** An operator runs the Bright Data AI healing command. The proposed output can be inspected first. `bdata scraper approve` is only called with the explicit `--approve` flag, preserving the human-in-the-loop default.
5. **Recovery.** The healed snapshot is compared to the broken snapshot. Approval is recorded only when at least one dropped field recovers above 80% completeness.
6. **Narration.** Gemini `gemini-2.5-flash-lite` receives a structured JSON schema. Its site, fields, and current row count are validated against the real diff before trust. Any mismatch, malformed response, missing key, or API failure becomes a deterministic report with `narration_source: "fallback"`.

## Setup

### 1. Install Bright Data CLI and Python dependencies

```bash
npm install -g @brightdata/cli
python -m venv .venv
# Windows PowerShell
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The frontend dependencies are installed separately:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
cd ..
```

### 2. Configure secrets

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set:

```dotenv
BRIGHTDATA_API_TOKEN=your_bright_data_token
# If your CLI installation expects the alternate name, use the same value:
BRIGHTDATA_API_KEY=your_bright_data_token
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-2.5-flash-lite
# Local demo
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./backend/sentinelscrape.db
# Production / Neon
# DATABASE_URL=postgresql+psycopg://USER:PASSWORD@HOST/DB?sslmode=require
OPERATIONS_API_TOKEN=
```

For the dashboard, copy `frontend/.env.example` to `frontend/.env.local`. It runs as a local observer by default. In production, protect `OPERATIONS_API_TOKEN` at a server-side gateway before exposing collector mutation controls.

Authenticate the `bdata` CLI according to your Bright Data account setup. The application never stores the API token in the database.

### 3. Create the database

Run from the repository root:

```bash
python -m alembic -c backend/alembic.ini upgrade head
```

The migrations create `collectors`, `runs`, `products`, `price_history`, `incidents`, and per-user `favorites`.

### 4. Create the five Scraper Studio collectors

Run from the repository root:

```bash
python scripts/bootstrap_collectors.py
```

This calls `bdata scraper create` once per site and stores each returned `collector_id` in SQLite. Existing site registrations are left unchanged.

## Run the demo

Start the API from `backend/`:

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

In another terminal, run one polling cycle:

```bash
cd backend
python -m app.orchestration.scheduler --once
```

Or keep polling on the configured interval:

```bash
python -m app.orchestration.scheduler
```

Start the dashboard in a third terminal:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:5173`. It is now one responsive, scroll-driven observatory rather than a static dashboard:

- **Landing:** the self-healing loop as the product story.
- **Control room:** paginated market listings with search, market filters, price sparklines, signals, and the Trust Layer.
- **Signals:** a larger impact desk for filtering price drops and restocks.
- **Trust layer / Network:** the full incident trace and per-collector health views.
- **Intelligence:** a Gemini brief that is explicitly grounded in verified price/restock counts and open incidents, plus the existing Search and Docs-RAG APIs for deeper research.
- **Your watchlist:** local saved favorites. Selecting a product opens a quick-glance sheet with price trace, save, share, and retailer controls.

The control room has three core panels:

- **Live listings:** product, latest price, availability, listing link, and price-history sparkline.
- **Alerts:** latest price drops and restocks derived from adjacent observations.
- **Trust Layer:** reverse-chronological incidents with broken fields, recovered fields, row counts, narration, and Gemini/fallback provenance.

### Run the self-healing loop from the UI

The header **Run live scan** and the in-page **Self-healing protocol** both create a persisted Bright Data operation—this is not a browser refresh. The UI polls its transcript while each collector runs. When the detector finds a completeness collapse, it exposes two deliberate controls:

1. **Propose AI heal** calls `bdata scraper heal` with the incident's actual dropped fields and saves the proposal for review.
2. **Approve + verify** calls the Bright Data approval flow, re-runs the repaired collector, writes recovered fields and product observations, then asks Gemini for the guardrailed narration.

For safety, these controls are available to the built-in local observer only in development. Production must set `APP_ENV=production` and protect requests with a server-side `OPERATIONS_API_TOKEN`; do not expose that token in the browser.

The collector-health rail above the panels is intentionally factual: each site is green only when its latest persisted run succeeded and it has no open incident. That gives the demo a compact “wall of checks” without inventing live data.

### Prove detection and recovery locally

Use this safe, no-network proof first. It deliberately removes a field from a fixture, applies the exact `>80% → <20%` detector, then restores it:

```bash
python scripts/demo_self_heal.py --field rating
```

Expected output is `rating` in both `detected` and `recovered`. For a live proof, press **Run Bright Data scan** in local development. The operation panel records the scan; if a field collapses, it offers **Propose AI heal** and then **Approve + verify**. The verification re-runs the repaired collector and only marks the incident healed after the measured recovery.

## Deploy: Render + Neon + Vercel

The repository includes a `Dockerfile` and `render.yaml`. The Render web service serves the API; the Render cron service runs the fully automatic scan → detect → heal → approve → verify cycle every 30 minutes. Both must point at the same Neon database, so the public dashboard can display the persistent Trust Layer evidence.

1. Create a Neon database and copy its pooled connection string into `DATABASE_URL` using `postgresql+psycopg://...`.
2. In Render, create a Blueprint from this repository. Fill `DATABASE_URL`, `BRIGHTDATA_API_TOKEN`, `BRIGHTDATA_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`, and a long random `OPERATIONS_API_TOKEN` for the web service. Give the cron service the same database and Bright Data/Gemini values.
3. After Vercel creates the frontend deployment, set the web service `CORS_ORIGINS` to `https://YOUR-VERCEL-DOMAIN`. Redeploy the API.
4. In Vercel, set the project root directory to `frontend`. Add `VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://YOUR-RENDER-API.onrender.com` and `VITE_MANUAL_OPERATIONS=false`, then deploy.

Production intentionally makes operation reads public but hides write controls. Visitors can inspect the latest automatic operation and its timestamped transcript, while only the server-side Render cron owns expensive Bright Data mutations. `OPERATIONS_API_TOKEN` never goes into Vercel or browser code.

## GitHub Actions: scrapers in CI

`.github/workflows/sentinel-self-heal.yml` runs every 30 minutes and can also be started manually. Add `BRIGHTDATA_API_TOKEN`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`, and Neon `DATABASE_URL` as repository secrets, then enable the workflow. Each run:

1. creates or reuses the five collectors;
2. runs the snapshots and checks completeness drift;
3. heals an open incident from the detected field description;
4. explicitly approves the fix in CI mode;
5. re-runs the collectors and fails if an incident remains open;
6. uploads `backend/output/` and writes a run summary to the Actions page.

Local operation remains human-in-the-loop by default. Only the workflow sets `AUTO_APPROVE_HEALS=true`, making the “scrapers in CI, no humans” policy explicit and reviewable.

## Resource track coverage

The project now covers the relevant functionality from resources 04–09:

- **04 — Self-healing scraper:** `scripts/demo_self_heal.py` creates a deterministic field break/recovery proof; the live path uses the detected incident description with `bdata scraper heal`, verifies recovery, approves, and re-runs.
- **05 — Scrapers in CI:** `.github/workflows/sentinel-self-heal.yml` runs the complete loop on a cron and leaves a summary plus collector JSON artifacts.
- **06 — Docs to RAG:** `scripts/build_docs_rag.py` uses Bright Data to fetch a sitemap and pages, chunks them, embeds them with `gemini-embedding-001` when configured, and stores a cited index. `scripts/query_docs.py` and `POST /rag/query` answer with source URLs.
- **07 — Competitive intel:** `scripts/competitive_intel.py` diffs three to five configured competitor pages weekly and can deliver a short update to Slack or Discord. The Monday workflow restores the prior observation baseline from Actions cache before creating the next diff.
- **08 — Keyword-powered agent:** `scripts/keyword_agent.py` and `POST /research` use Bright Data Search with a plain-English keyword, optional country, and search type.
- **09 — Parallel scraper battle:** `scripts/parallel_scraper_battle.py` fans out independent site agents concurrently, scores extraction coverage, and writes a deterministic judge result to `battle.json`.

Set `COMPETITOR_SOURCES_JSON` to a JSON array such as:

```json
[{"name":"Apify","url":"https://apify.com/changelog"},{"name":"Zyte","url":"https://www.zyte.com/changelog/"},{"name":"ScrapingBee","url":"https://www.scrapingbee.com/changelog/"}]
```

## Demonstrate a heal

When an incident is open, inspect it through `GET /incidents` or the Trust Layer. First propose a heal without approval:

```bash
cd backend
python -m app.orchestration.scheduler --heal INCIDENT_ID
```

The healed JSON is written under `backend/output/`, but the incident stays open. Review the output, then run:

```bash
python -m app.orchestration.scheduler --heal INCIDENT_ID --approve
```

The second command runs `bdata scraper heal`, verifies the recovered fields, calls `bdata scraper approve`, upserts the healed products/prices, and narrates the incident. The same workflow is available through `scripts/run_scheduler.ps1`.

## API

- `GET /health`
- `GET /collectors`
- `GET /products?site=eBay&page=1&page_size=8&q=laptop`
- `GET /incidents?page=1&page_size=50`
- `GET /alerts?page=1&page_size=50`
- `GET /me/profile`, `GET /me/favorites`, `PUT|DELETE /me/favorites/{product_id}`
- `GET /insights/market`
- `POST /operations/scan` — authenticated/local-dev live Bright Data collector run
- `POST /operations/incidents/{id}/heal` — create a Bright Data AI heal proposal
- `POST /operations/incidents/{id}/approve` — approve, re-run, verify, and narrate
- `GET /operations/latest`, `GET /operations/{id}` — persisted operational transcript

The paginated endpoints return `{items, page, page_size, total, total_pages}` so the UI can move through the full dataset without loading every listing into the first screen.
- `POST /research`
- `POST /rag/query`

Build a documentation index and query it:

```bash
python scripts/build_docs_rag.py https://docs.example.com/sitemap.xml
python scripts/query_docs.py "How do I authenticate?"
```

Run keyword research or the parallel battle:

```bash
python scripts/keyword_agent.py "best laptop under $800" --country us
python scripts/parallel_scraper_battle.py --sites ebay,newegg,target
```

## Verification

```bash
cd backend
python -m pytest -q
```

The test suite covers the exact 80%/20% threshold behavior, empty-value semantics, wrapped fake snapshots, Gemini schema validation, and deterministic fallback behavior. The frontend production build is checked with:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
```
